# Full-Array-Algorithm-Sorter
This Program uses an Array Data Structure with a full library of Sort Algorithms to test speed and run time:

On Run:
This Program will ask the User, how large the array is, and then will generate random integers for each index of the array.
Then the User will be prompted to Select 6 different sorting algorithms in a infinite loop until prompted to stop such as:
1. Heap Sort
2. Merge Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Hybrid Quick Sort
5. Radix Sort
6. Bubble Sort

Then the program will display the Unsorted Array, then the Sorted Array, then the Resorted Array to compare run time between Sorted and Resorted.
